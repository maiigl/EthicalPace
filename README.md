## Initial Situation
The idea for this project arose from a desire to create a platform where individuals could express their political beliefs while engaging in physical activity. With an increasing interest in combining activism with everyday actions, there's a market for politically-themed apparel that aligns with people's values.

## Description

These jerseys will feature messages promoting various social and political causes, such as veganism, anti-racism, and freedom of speech. The goal is to offer a unique product that allows individuals to make a statement while pursuing their fitness goals.
